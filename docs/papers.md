  - The Grothendeick ring of varieties is a fundamental object of study in algebraic geometry. Using her formalism of assemblers, Inna Zhakarevich defined a spectrum whose $pi_0$ is this Grothendieck ring. By modifying techniques of Waldhausen, I give another definition of this spectrum, as well as producing maps out of it to other spectra of interest. These maps can be considered as various forms of "derived" motivic measures.
