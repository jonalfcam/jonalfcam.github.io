  - We show an agreement between two different "iterated traces", generalizing work of Ben-Zvi and Nadler. This can be used to prove a wide array of index-type theorems, as well as recover the modular invariance of categorical 2-characters.

  - We show that an important classical fixed point invariant, the Reidemeister trace, arises as a topological Hochschild homology transfer. This generalizes a corresponding classical result for the Euler characteristic and is a first step in showing the Reidemeister trace is in the image of the cyclotomic trace. The main result follows from developing the relationship between shadows, topological Hochschild homology, and Morita invariance in bicategorical generality.

  - The Grothendeick ring of varieties is a fundamental object of study in algebraic geometry. Using her formalism of assemblers, Inna Zhakarevich defined a spectrum whose $pi_0$ is this Grothendieck ring. By modifying techniques of Waldhausen, I give another definition of this spectrum, as well as producing maps out of it to other spectra of interest. These maps can be considered as various forms of "derived" motivic measures.

  - This paper complements "Homotopy Theoretic Classification of Symmetry Protected Phases" (see below). We provide background on computations in homotopy theory, and compute a number of low-dimensional homotopy groups of cobordism spectra.
